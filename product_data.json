Only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the ear cover area: after about 10 minutes of listening to music (at an average volume, not too loud) the ear cushion area starts to push pressure on the outer parts of the ears and cause a serious ache.

I was only able to use them briefly within a 24 hour span. They quit charging, turning on, and I got nowhere with trying to connect with a tech specialist on their website to troubleshoot the issue. Walmart was amazing in response to their 30-day return policy. I got my money back on a gift card to go towards my next order. Instead I was gifted a pair of Sony Headphones for Xmas. A brief plug for them. They are 1000% times better than the Beats in every way!!From ear comfort/coverage, to sound quality, battery life, and tech specs. I highly recommend checking out the Sony WH-1000XM4. Granted they are more in price and definitely worth every penny!!!",

However, my experience has been rather disappointing due to the flimsy build of these headphones. From the moment I started using them, it was evident that the durability was lacking. The materials used feel fragile and not up to the standards I had expected from a brand like Beats. As someone who values both quality sound and sturdiness, it's disheartening to see a product fall short in the latter aspect. While I appreciate the audio performance, the Solo 3 headphones are not suitable for those seeking headphones that can withstand a bit of daily rough handling.",

You have enough treble and the bass and especially the mid bass is incredible. If you don't like the way these sound there is something wrong with your ears. The Bluetooth battery lasts forever and charges quick. These are definitely worth getting. They will be all you use. These sound good with metal, edm and rap everything sounds good. I had the solo 2 wired ones they are similar sound. I loved those, that's why I bought these. I recommend these for any average music enjoyer to the point I think your missing out if you don't have them. I use them every day. I hope they make these forever and never discontinue this headphones it is a timeless design! Thanks apple for designing these awesome headphones. The price is affordable too compared to other headphones. I recommend buying a 3.5 to 3.5 mm cable to use it wired too. Excuse the poor quality pic. These look good in black!",

So I had to go to another store that had the product in stock. Return the original online purchase. Then argue with the customer service desk to get them to honor the price I have originally paid for online. The explanation I got in the Rocky Hill Connecticut store from the service desk manager was that walmart.com. It is not associated with the Walmart store and it was not their issue or problem. She did eventually after a lengthy discussion. Agree to honor the online price this one time. But the whole process took me more than half a day to complete. I will never order from Walmart online again no matter how much the price is discounted. The service was terrible, and nobody wanted to speak to me or help.",
